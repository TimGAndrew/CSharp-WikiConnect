The establishment of the ''[[City of Halifax|Town of Halifax]]'', named after the [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|2nd Earl of Halifax]], in 1749 led to the colonial capital being transferred from [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]].\n[[File:Sambroandcannons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sambro Island Lighthouse]], the oldest lighthouse in [[North America]] (1758)]]\n\n[[File:Lower Water Street, Halifax seen from the gate of the main Guard House, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|Lower Water Street, Halifax seen from the gate of the main Guard House, Nova Scotia, June 1823.]]\n\nThe establishment of Halifax marked the beginning of [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. The war began when [[Edward Cornwallis]] arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports and a sloop of war on June 21, 1749.<ref>Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire.

To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian, and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|(Citadel Hill)]] (1749), Bedford ([[Fort Sackville (Nova Scotia)|Fort Sackville]]) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), and [[Lawrencetown, Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]] (1754), all areas within the modern-day Regional Municipality. [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margaret's Bay]] was first settled by French-speaking [[Foreign Protestants]] at [[French Village, Nova Scotia]] who migrated from [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] during the American Revolution.\n\nDecember 1917 saw one of the greatest disasters in Canadian history, when the {{SS|Mont-Blanc}}, a French cargo ship carrying munitions, collided with the Belgian Relief vessel {{SS|Imo}} in \"The Narrows\" between upper Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin. The resulting explosion, the [[Halifax Explosion]], devastated the [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond District]] of Halifax, killing approximately 2,000 people and injuring nearly 9,000 others.<ref name=cbc>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/halifaxexplosion/he2_ruins/he2_ruins_explosion.html |title=CBC - Halifax Explosion 1917 |publisher=CBC.ca |date=September 19, 2003 |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> The blast was the [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions#Rank order of largest conventional explosions#detonations by magnitude|largest artificial explosion]] before the development of nuclear weapons.<ref name=TimeDisaster>{{cite book|title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|year=2012|page=56|isbn=1-60320-247-1}}</ref> Significant aid came from [[Boston]], strengthening the [[Boston–Halifax relations|bond between the two coastal cities]].\n\nThe four municipalities in the Halifax urban area had been coordinating service delivery through the ''Metropolitan Authority'' since the late 1970s, but remained independent towns and cities until April 1, 1996, when the provincial government [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] all municipal governments within [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] to create the Halifax Regional Municipality.

On April 15, 2014, the regional council approved the implementation of a new branding campaign for the region developed by the local firm Revolve Marketing. The campaign would see the region referred to in promotional materials simply as \"Halifax\", although \"Halifax Regional Municipality\" would remain the region's official name. The proposed rebranding was met with mixed reaction from residents, some of whom felt that the change would alienate other communities in the municipality through a perception that the marketing scheme would focus on Metropolitan Halifax only, while others expressed relief that the longer formal name would no longer be primary. Mayor Mike Savage defended the decision, stating: \"I'm a [[Westphal, Nova Scotia|Westphal]] guy, I'm a [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] man, but Halifax is my city, we’re all part of Halifax. Why does that matter?

Halifax currently accounts for 40% of Nova Scotia's population, and 15% of that of [[Atlantic Canada]]. Metropolitan Halifax benefits from a process of increased rural depopulation and corresponding urban growth in Atlantic Canada during the late 20th century—a demographic shift that was delayed several decades in the region compared with other parts of [[North America]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main article|Buildings and structures in Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\n{{Further information|List of tallest buildings in Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\nHalifax's urban core is home to a number of regional landmark buildings and retains significant historic buildings and districts. The downtown's office towers are overlooked by the fortress of [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]] with its iconic [[Halifax Town Clock]].\n\nThe architecture of Halifax's [[South End, Halifax|South End]] is renowned for its grand Victorian houses while the [[West End, Halifax|West End]] and [[North End, Halifax]] have many blocks of well-preserved wooden residential houses with notable features such as the \"Halifax Porch\". [[Dalhousie University]]'s campus is often featured in films and documentaries. Dartmouth also has its share of historic neighbourhoods.\n\nThe urban core is home to several blocks of typical North American high-rise office buildings, however segments of the downtown are governed by height restrictions which prevent buildings from obstructing certain sight lines between [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]] and [[Halifax Harbour]]. This has resulted in some modern high rises being built at unusual angles or locations.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ 10 Tallest Buildings in Halifax\n|-\n! Name !! Height !!

The original grid plan devised when Halifax was founded in 1749 included a central [[military parade]] square, the [[Grand Parade (Halifax)|Grand Parade]]. The square hosts the City Hall at one end, and is a popular site for concerts, political demonstrations, as well as the annual [[Remembrance Day]] ceremony at the central cenotaph. Another popular downtown public space is the timber [[Halifax Boardwalk]], which stretches approximately three kilometres and is integrated with several squares and monuments.\n\nThe [[Halifax Common]], granted for the use of citizens in 1763, is Canada's oldest public park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parks Civic Support Program|url=https://www.halifax.ca/MunicipalOps/documents/GiftsforParksBrochure.pdf|publisher=Halifax Regional Municipality|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> Centrally located on the Halifax peninsula, the wide fields are a popular location for sports. The slopes of [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]], overlooking downtown, are favoured by sunbathers and kite-flyers. The [[Halifax Public Gardens]], a short walk away, are Victorian era public gardens formally established in 1867 and designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in 1984. [[Victoria Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Victoria Park]], across the street, contains various monuments and statues erected by the [[North British Society]], as well as a fountain. In contrast to the urban parks, the expansive [[Point Pleasant Park]] at the southern tip of the peninsula is heavily forested and contains the remains of numerous British fortifications.\n\nLocated on the opposite side of the harbour, the [[Dartmouth Commons]] is a large park next to [[Downtown Dartmouth]] laid out in the 1700s. It is home to the Leighton Dillman gardens and various sports grounds. Nearby, the Dartmouth waterfront trail stretches from Downtown Dartmouth to Woodside. Among residents of central Dartmouth, the area around [[Sullivan's Pond]] and [[Lake Banook]] is popular for strolling and paddling. The forested [[Shubie Park]], through which the historic [[Shubenacadie Canal]] runs, is a major park in suburban Dartmouth.\n\n[[Mainland Halifax]] is home to several significant parks, including [[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], gifted to the people of Halifax by Sir [[Sandford Fleming]]. It houses the Dingle Tower, dedicated in 1912 by the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] to commemorate 150 years of representative government in Nova Scotia. The Mainland Common, in [[Clayton Park, Nova Scotia|Clayton Park]], is a modern park home to various sports and community facilities. [[Long Lake Provincial Park (Nova Scotia)|Long Lake Provincial Park]], comprising more than 2,000 hectares, was designated in 1984 and affords Halifax residents access to a scenic wilderness in close proximity to the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Lake Provincial Park Draft Park Management Plan|url=http://novascotia.ca/natr/parks/management/longlake.asp|publisher=Province of Nova Scotia|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Rural area ===\nHalifax is centred on the urban core and surrounded by areas of decreasing population density. Rural areas lie to the east, west and north of the urban core. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] lies to the south. Certain rural communities on the urban fringe function as [[suburban]] or [[exurban]] areas, with the majority of those residents commuting to and working in the urban core.\n\nFarther away, rural communities in the municipality function like any resource-based area in Nova Scotia, being sparsely populated and their local economies developing around four major resource industries: [[agriculture]], in the Musquodoboit Valley, [[fishing]], along the coast, [[mining]], in the Musquodoboit Valley<ref>{{cite web|title=Mosher Limestone|url=http://www.mosherlimestone.com/|publisher=Mosher Limestone Co.

[[Spring Garden, Halifax|Spring Garden]], adjacent to downtown Halifax, is a lively mixed-use neighbourhood with a variety of shopping and entertainment options as well as the new [[Halifax Central Library]]. The area has seen an uptick in development over the past few years, with new housing being built on most of the surface parking lots. The [[North End, Halifax|North End]] is a multicultural and artistic neighbourhood with a long history centred on several community nodes including the venerable Gottingen Street and [[The Hydrostone|Hydrostone]] commercial areas. The [[Quinpool District]] forms the community centre of the [[West End, Halifax|West End]]. [[Downtown Dartmouth]] offers dining and shopping and has also been subject to revitalization with the redevelopment of the [[Dartmouth Marine Slips]] as the King's Wharf housing area. [[North Preston]], just outside Dartmouth, is Canada's largest and oldest black community.\n\nHalifax is also known for its high walkability, particularly on the [[Halifax Peninsula]], where 25-50% of residents regularly walk to work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Connections: 2014-19 Halifax Active Transportation Priorities Plan|url=http://www.halifax.ca/boardscom/atac/documents/makingconnections2014-2019halifaxactivetransportationprioritiesplan_attachment1.pdf|publisher=Halifax Regional Municipality|page=6}}</ref> Unlike numerous other North American cities, expressways were never built in the urban core (with the exception of the truncated [[Cogswell Interchange|Harbour Drive]]), resulting in high pedestrian connectivity. Peninsular Halifax is also mixed-use, contributing to an elevated quality of urban convenience and vibrancy as compared to suburban districts with highly segregated land use and car-oriented transportation networks. In recent years, the city has also begun to place increased emphasis on developing bicycling infrastructure.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main article|Culture of Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\n[[File:ArgyleStreetHalifax.jpg|thumb|left|Argyle Street, home to many bars, restaurants, and music venues]]\n\nHalifax is a major cultural centre within the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]]. The city has maintained many of its maritime and military traditions, while opening itself to a growing multicultural population. The municipality's urban core also benefits from a large population of post-secondary students who strongly influence the local cultural scene. Halifax has a number of art galleries, theatres and museums, as well as most of the region's national-quality sports and entertainment facilities. Halifax is also the home to many of the region's major cultural attractions, such as [[Halifax Pop Explosion]], [[Symphony Nova Scotia]], the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]], [[The Khyber]], the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] and the Neptune Theatre. The region is noted for the strength of its music scene and nightlife, especially in the central urban core. See [[List of musical groups from Halifax, Nova Scotia]] for a partial list.\n[[File:HistoricHalifax.jpg|thumb|[[Historic Properties (Halifax)|Historic Properties]]]]\nHalifax hosts a wide variety of festivals that take place throughout the year, including the [[Atlantic Film Festival]], the [[Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo]], the Halifax International Busker Festival, Greekfest, the Atlantic Jazz Festival, the Multicultural Festival, the largest Canada Day celebration east of Ottawa, [[Natal Day]], the [[Halifax Pop Explosion]], periodic Tall Ship events, [[White Night festivals|Nocturne Festival]], and Shakespeare by the Sea, to name a few. [[Halifax Pride]] is the largest LGBT event in Atlantic Canada and one of the largest in the country. Many of Halifax's festivals and annual events have become world-renowned over the past several years.\n\nHalifax is home to many performance venues, namely the [[Dalhousie Arts Centre|Rebecca Cohn Auditorium]], the [[Neptune Theatre (Halifax)|Neptune Theatre]], and The Music Room. The Neptune Theatre, a 43-year-old establishment located on Argyle Street, is Halifax's largest theatre. It performs an assortment of professionally produced plays year-round. The [[Shakespeare by the Sea, Halifax|Shakespeare by the Sea]] theatre company performs at nearby [[Point Pleasant Park]]. Eastern Front Theatre performs at [[Alderney Landing]] in [[Downtown Dartmouth|Downtown]] [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] which can easily be accessed via the [[Halifax Transit]] [[ferry]] service. There are smaller performance venues at the [[Halifax Central Library]], [[Citadel High School]] (Spatz Theatre), and [[Halifax West High School]] ([[Bella Rose Arts Centre]]).\n\nHalifax has also become a significant film-production centre, with many American and Canadian filmmakers using the streetscapes, often to stand in for other cities that are more expensive to work in. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] has its Atlantic Canada production centres (radio and television) based in Halifax, and quite a number of radio and television programs are made in the region for national broadcast.\n\nThe new [[Halifax Central Library]] on [[Spring Garden, Halifax|Spring Garden Road]] has received accolades for its architecture and has been described as a new cultural locus, offering many community facilities including a 300-seat auditorium.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Peggys Cove Nova Scotia 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia|Peggy's Cove Lighthouse]]]]\nHalifax's tourism industry showcases Nova Scotia's culture, scenery and coastline. There are several museums and art galleries in downtown Halifax. The [[Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21]], an immigrant entry point prominent throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, was opened to the public as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1999 and is the only [[National museums of Canada|national museum]] in the Atlantic provinces. The [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] is a [[maritime museum]] containing extensive galleries including a large exhibit on the famous ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', over 70 small craft and a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} steamship [[CSS Acadia|CSS ''Acadia'']]. In summertime the preserved World War II [[Flower class corvette|corvette]] {{HMCS|Sackville}} operates as a museum ship and Canada's naval memorial. The [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is housed in a 150-year-old building containing over 9000 works of art. The [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]] in Dartmouth reflects the region's rich ethnic heritage.\n\nHalifax has numerous [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Sites]], most notably [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)]]. Just outside the urban area, the iconic [[Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia|Peggys Cove]] is internationally recognized and receives more than 600,000 visitors a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peggy's Cove: Assessment of Capacity Issues and Potential Tourism Opportunities |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/tch/pubs/peggyscove_report.pdf |publisher=''The Economic Planning Group of Canada'' |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Granville Mall Halifax 2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Granville Mall (Halifax)|Granville Mall]]]]\nThe waterfront in Downtown Halifax is the site of the [[Halifax Boardwalk|''Halifax Harbourwalk'']], a 3-km [[boardwalk]] popular amongst tourists and locals alike. Many mid-sized ships dock here at one of the many wharfs. The harbourwalk is home to a [[Halifax Transit]] ferry terminal, hundreds of stores, ''Historic Properties'', several office buildings, the [[Casino Nova Scotia]], and several public squares where [[busking|buskers]] perform, most prominently at the annual Halifax International Busker Festival every August.\n\nDowntown Halifax, home to many small shops and vendors, is a major shopping area. It is also home to several shopping centres, including [[Scotia Square]], Barrington Place Shops, and [[Maritime Centre (Halifax)|Maritime Mall]]. Numerous malls on [[Spring Garden, Halifax|Spring Garden Road]], including the [[Park Lane Mall]], are also located nearby. The area is home to approximately 200 restaurants and bars, offering a wide array of world cuisines.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Downtown|url=http://downtownhalifax.ca/index.php/experience/|publisher=Downtown Halifax Business Commission|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> There are also more than 60 sidewalk cafes that open in the summer months. The nightlife is made up of bars and small music venues as well as [[Casino Nova Scotia]], a large facility built partially over the water.\n\nCruise ships visit the province frequently. In 2015, the Port of Halifax welcomed 141 vessel calls with 222,309 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://cruisehalifax.ca/our-visitors/statistics/|publisher=Cruise Halifax|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{main article|Sport in Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\n[[File:Town Clock, Halifax, NS, May 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Town Clock as seen from Citadel Hill, with the [[Scotiabank Centre]] to the left]]\n\nHalifax has various recreational areas, including ocean and lake beaches and rural and urban parks. It has a host of organised community intramural sports at various facilities. Public schools and post-secondary institutions offer varsity and intramural sports.\n\nThe [[Scotiabank Centre]] is largest arena in [[Atlantic Canada]]. It plays host to most of the major sporting events and concerts that visit Halifax and is home to [[Sports teams in the Halifax Regional Municipality|several semi-professional sport franchises]], including the [[Halifax Hurricanes]] of the [[NBL Canada]] and the [[Halifax Mooseheads]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The [[Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] is held here every year. The facility is connected to the [[Downtown Halifax Link]], and directly to the [[World Trade and Convention Centre]].\n\nThe region has hosted several major sporting events, including the 2003 [[World Junior Hockey Championship]], [[2003 Nokia Brier]], the [[2004 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships]], the 2005 [[Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], and 2007 [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]]. From 1984 to 2007, the region was home to the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport men's basketball champions|CIS Men's Basketball Championship]]; the tournament was moved to [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], from 2008 to 2010 and returned to Halifax in 2011 and 2012. The [[2008 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] was held between May 2 and 18, 2008, in Halifax and [[Quebec City]].\n\nHalifax was selected in 2006 as the host city in Canada's bid for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] but withdrew on March 8, 2007, well before the November 9, 2007 selection date, citing financial uncertainties. In February 2011, the municipality hosted the [[2011 Canada Winter Games|2011]] [[Canada Winter Games]].\n\nOn May 26, 2013, the [[Halifax Mooseheads]] capped a 74-win season (going 74-7-3-1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theqmjhl.ca/standings/show/ls_season/172/subtype/0 |title=QMJHL Network |publisher=Theqmjhl.ca |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>) by defeating the [[Portland Winterhawks]] 6-4 in the MasterCard Memorial Cup Final, earning their first Memorial Cup in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariohockeyleague.com/article/halifax-mooseheads-win-mastercard-memorial-cup |title=OHL Network |publisher=Ontariohockeyleague.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHalifax is also home to several rugby clubs, the Halifax Rugby Football Club, Halifax Tars, Dartmouth PigDogs, Riverlake Ramblers and the Eastern Shore Rugby Football Club. The city is now also home to an Australian Rules Football team. The Halifax Gaels are the local [[Hurling]] and [[Gaelic Football]] team that compete in [[Canadian GAA]] events.\n\n===Media===\n{{main article|Media in Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\n\nHalifax is the Atlantic region's central point for radio broadcast and press media. [[CBC Television]], [[CTV Television Network]] (CTV), and [[Global Television Network]] and other broadcasters all have important regional television concentrators in HRM. [[CBC Radio]] has a major regional studio and there are also regional hubs for Rogers Radio and various private broadcast franchises, as well as a regional bureau for [[The Canadian Press]]/[[The Canadian Press|Broadcast News]].\n\nHalifax's print media is centred on its single daily newspaper, the broadsheet ''[[The Chronicle Herald|Chronicle Herald]]'' as well as two free newspapers, the daily commuter-oriented edition of ''[[Metro International]]'' and the free alternative arts weekly ''[[The Coast]]''. ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' provides the municipality with a bi-weekly satirical and gossip magazine.\n\nThe city has several [[online newspaper|online daily newspapers]]. ''[[allNovaScotia]]'' is a daily, subscriber-only outlet which focuses on business and political news from across the province.<ref name=brad>{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=James|title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|website=Globe and Mail|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> ''[[Local Xpress]]'' is a free, journalist-run daily online newspaper covering local and national news, sports, business and entertainment. The ''[[Halifax Examiner]]'' was founded by the former news editor of ''The Coast'' in 2014 and, like ''allNovaScotia'', is supported through subscriptions.\n\nFrom 1974-2008, Halifax had a second daily newspaper, the tabloid ''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|The Daily News]]'' which still publishes several neighbourhood weekly papers such as ''The Bedford-Sackville Weekly News'', ''The Halifax West-Clayton Park Weekly News'' and the ''Dartmouth-Cole Harbour Weekly News''. These weekly papers compete with ''The Chronicle-Herald'''s weekly Community Heralds ''HRM West'', ''HRM East'', and ''HRM North''.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:ProspectVillage01.jpg|thumb|right|Village of [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]]]]\n{{main article|Geography of Halifax, Nova Scotia}}\n\nUnlike most municipalities with a sizable [[metropolitan area]], the Halifax Regional Municipality's suburbs have been completely incorporated into the \"central\" municipality, often by referendum. For example, the community of [[Spryfield, Nova Scotia|Spryfield]], in the Mainland South area, voted to amalgamate with Halifax in 1968. The most recent amalgamation, which brought the entirety of Halifax County into the Municipality, has created a situation where a large \"rural commutershed\" area encompasses almost half the municipality's landmass.\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe Halifax Regional Municipality occupies an area of 5,577 square kilometres (2,353&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),<ref>[http://www.destinationhalifax.com/downloads/HfxRegionalMunicipality.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508120019/http://www.destinationhalifax.com/downloads/HfxRegionalMunicipality.pdf |date=May 8, 2006 }}</ref> which is approximately 10% of the total land area of Nova Scotia. The land area of HRM is comparable in size to the total land area of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], and measures approximately 165 kilometres (102.5&nbsp;mi) in length between its eastern and western-most extremities, excluding [[Sable Island]]. The nearest point of land to Sable Island is not in HRM, but rather in adjacent [[Guysborough County, Nova Scotia|Guysborough County]]. However, Sable Island is considered part of District 7 of the Halifax Regional Council.\n\n[[File:Greenwood NS.JPG|thumb|right|[[Musquodoboit Valley]]]]\nThe [[coastline]] is heavily indented, accounting for its length of approximately 400 kilometres (250&nbsp;mi), with the northern boundary of the municipality usually being between 50-60 kilometres (30-37&nbsp;mi) inland. The coast is mostly rock with small isolated sand beaches in sheltered bays. The largest coastal features include [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]], [[Halifax Harbour]]/[[Bedford Basin]], [[Cole Harbour (natural harbour)|Cole Harbour]], [[Musquodoboit Harbour]], Jeddore Harbour, Ship Harbour, Sheet Harbour, and Ecum Secum Harbour. The municipality's topography spans from lush [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] in the [[Musquodoboit Valley]] to rocky and heavily forested rolling hills. It includes a number of islands and peninsulas, among them [[McNabs Island]], [[Beaver Island, Nova Scotia|Beaver Island]], [[Melville Island (Nova Scotia)|Melville Island]], [[Deadman's Island (Nova Scotia)|Deadman's Island]] and [[Sable Island]].\n\n===Climate===\nHalifax has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), bordering on an [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and relatively mild winters, which is due to [[Gulf Stream]] moderation. The [[weather]] is usually milder in the winter or cooler in the summer than areas at similar latitudes inland, with the temperature remaining (with occasional notable exceptions) between about −8&nbsp;°C (17.6&nbsp;°F) and 24&nbsp;°C (76&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 Station Data|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&StationName=halifax&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> January is the coldest month, being the only month with a high that is slightly below freezing at {{convert|-0.1|C|F}}, while August is the warmest. The sea heavily influences the climate of the area, causing significant [[seasonal lag]] in summer, with August being significantly warmer than June and with September being the third mildest month in terms of mean temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6357&lang=e&amp;StationName=Halifax+Citadel&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=4&dispBack=1|title=Climate Normals for Halifax Citadel 1981-2010|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> The January mean is only 1.1&nbsp;°C colder than the isotherm for the oceanic climate.\n\nPrecipitation is high year-round. Winter features a mix of rain, freezing rain and snow with frequent freeze-thaw cycles. Snowfall is heavy in winter, but snow cover is usually patchy owing to the frequent freeze-thaw cycles, which melt accumulated snow. Some winters feature colder temperatures and fewer freeze-thaw cycles; the most recent of which being the winter of 2014–2015, which was the coldest, snowiest and stormiest in about a century. Spring is often wet and cool and arrives much later than in areas of Canada at similar latitudes, due to cooler sea temperatures. Summers are mild and pleasant, with hot and humid conditions very infrequent. Warm, pleasant conditions often extend well into September, sometimes into mid-October. Average monthly precipitation is highest from November to February due to intense late-fall to winter storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S., and lowest in summer, with August being the year's warmest and driest month on average. Halifax can sometimes receive hurricanes, mostly between August and October. An example is when hurricane [[Hurricane Juan]], a category 2 storm, hit in September 2003 and caused considerable damage to the region. Hurricane Earl grazed the coast as a category 1 storm in 2010. Atlantic sea surface temperatures have risen in recent years, making Halifax and the coast of Nova Scotia somewhat more susceptible to hurricanes than the area had been in the past.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in the city of Halifax was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 10 July 1912,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1871-04-01%7C1933-07-31&mlyRange=1871-01-01%7C1933-12-01&StationID=6355&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=2&searchMethod=contains&Month=7&Day=13&txtStationName=halifax&timeframe=2&Year=1912 |title=July 1912 climate summary for Halifax |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=September 22, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> and the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|-29.4|C|0}} on 18 February 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1871-04-01%7C1933-07-31&mlyRange=1871-01-01%7C1933-12-01&StationID=6355&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=2&searchMethod=contains&txtStationName=halifax&timeframe=2&Year=1922&Month=2# |title=February 1922 climate summary for Halifax |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=September 22, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> The [[March 2012 North American heat wave]] brought unusually high temperatures to the city of Halifax.

The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] have major installations along prominent sections of coastline in both Halifax and Dartmouth. The harbour is also home to a public ferry service connecting downtown Halifax to two locations in Dartmouth. Sheet Harbour is the other major port in the municipality and serves industrial shippers on the [[Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia)|Eastern Shore]].\n\nThe Halifax Port Authority's various shipping terminals constitute the eastern terminus of [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National Railway's]] transcontinental network. [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] provides overnight passenger rail service from the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia railway station|Halifax Railway Station]] three days a week to [[Montreal]] with the ''[[Ocean (train)|Ocean]]'', a train equipped with sleeper cars that stops in major centres along the way, such as Moncton. The Halifax Railway Station also serves as the terminus for [[Maritime Bus]] which serve destinations across [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\n[[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]] serves Halifax and most of the province, providing scheduled flights to domestic and international destinations. [[CFB Shearwater|Shearwater]], part of [[CFB Halifax]], is the air base for maritime helicopters employed by the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and is located on the eastern side of Halifax Harbour.\n\nThe urban core is linked by the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge|Angus L. Macdonald]] and [[A. Murray MacKay Bridge|A. Murray MacKay]] suspension bridges, as well as the network of [[100-series highways (Nova Scotia)|100-series highways]] which function as expressways. The [[Armdale traffic circle]] is an infamous choke point for vehicle movement in the western part of the urban core, especially at rush hour.\n\nPublic transit is provided by [[Halifax Transit]], which operates standard bus routes, bus-rapid transit routes, as well as the pedestrian-only [[Halifax-Dartmouth Ferry Service]].
